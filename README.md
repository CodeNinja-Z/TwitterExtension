	As Twitter provides the access to public of downloading tweets files (in JSON format), this client side application aims at loading local JSON files and render them in a highly readable way. Whenever someone would like to have a permanent copy of their favorite tweets and read them locally, they can achieve it by simply clicking some buttons within this web app.
